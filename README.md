# Making-fossil-fuels-from-earth-plankton-and-pressure
Use of methods similar to diamond creation for making fossile fuel. 
Use of sustained pressure and heat reacts organic material with carbon rich earth to create fossil fuel.

Test various organic materials.

Tust various types of earth minerals.

Look at results using compost.

Look at long term reactors that burns fuel at the point at which it becomes potent. Adding additional material would fuel energy for months ahead. Energy for pressure and heat could come from wind energy. Compost and earth mixing would be required for consistant power.

A wind turbine and pressure cooker could power an installation or support a population with materials found onsite.

This option could work in space.
